Research Points:
    Used to unlock upgrades(Starting cash after rebirth, increased ore limit, maybe even certain items from the shop?) and purchase boxes.
                            Boxes are basically a slot machine that reward random items that are at your tier, they are the only way to obtain Exotic items.
    Research Points are obtained by processing ore. Each furnace will award research points after processing X amount of ore. The amount of research points awarded will
    vary depending on the furnace being used.
