Try and clean up the side bar so its more organized(Put all droppers in a folder, put all ore in their own folder etc.)

Create the conveyor class/object types

    Have a method that is called whenever an ore changes position, this method notifys all subscribers/placed objects(upgrader, conveyor, Furnace) of the location of the ore, if the ore location matches with any of the placed items it calls their method.
        EX: An ores position is changed(a notification is sent out to all listeners) so that its now on the coordinates of an upgrader(listener), the upgrader checks and realizes that teh ores location matches with its own location so it calls its upgrade method on the ore.

Start the GUI side of things?

Save system?

Upgrade tags? 
    Sort of done, need to figure out a way to do it for complex upgraders(ones that can upgrade same ore multiple times.)

Implement position?

Implement other properties?
    Heat and cold, radiation etc.

Player Inventory?
