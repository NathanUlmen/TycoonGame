1. Ore is moving twice as fast as it should, I dont know what this is caused by yet....
This is being caused by the IdentifySystems method, which is adding the furnace twice which then creates a copy of the same system, causing it to fire twice each tick....
The Problem is caused by adding the furnace to a spot that was already on the map, even though the item is overriden/removed there are still two Point References to that spot...
